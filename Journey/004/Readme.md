## What is Lambda?

## Introduction 

Today I chose my own idea and am doing a micro project. I chose What is Lambda because I keep hearing about Lambda and wanted to learn more about it.

## So what is AWS Lambda? 

AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. You can start and stop the server when needed. Lambda is a serverless function, you pay only for the computer time that you consume and there is no charge when your server isn’t running. 

AWS Lambda runs your back end code, such as object uploads, Amazon S3 buckets, updates to DynamoDB, Tables, Data in Amazon Kinesis streams, or in app activity. 

## What is AWS Lambda is compatible with?

Ruby
Python
Java
Go
Powershell
NodeJs
C#

If you want to use another program you can use your own custom runtime that isn't AWS supported you just won’t have support from AWS.

## Lambda Costs?

Now this is one of the best things in my opinion about using Lambda because who doesn’t like affordable things? 
The first 1 million requests per month are free, once you exceed 1 million it’s $0.020 per additional request and you get 400,000GB seconds free per month. After that it costs $0.000066667 for every GB second. This price will vary on the amount of memory you use.

## Why would you want to use Lambda?

You would want use Lambda because it is hassel free and cheap.

## What is the most confusing thing about Lambda?

The most confusing thing about Lambda is it’s for people who code, so if you don’t know how to code.. well you won’t be able to use it.


## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

I learned about what Lambda is and why people use it.

## Next Steps

I may show how to use Lambda in my next project.
