# What is an EC2, a VM, an Instance and AMI?

## Cloud Research

## What is an EC2? 

EC2 stands for Elastic Compute Cloud and it's a highly configurable server. EC2 allows you to launch VMs.

## What is a VM?  

VM stands for Virutal Machine and it's a computer file usually called an image that acts like a computer. So, its a computer within a computer. You are able to create, copy, resize or migrate your server. You can run multiple VM's on a server to share cost with other customers.

## What is an Instance?

When we launce a VM its called an Instance.

## What is an AMI?

AMI stands for Amazon Machine Image.  So when using EC2 you can choose AMI options like:

* The amout of CPU
* The amount of Memory (RAM)
* The amount of Network Bandiwidth
* The Operation System
* Attach multiple virutal HDD's for storage


## So basically everything in AWS is using EC2 under the hood.
