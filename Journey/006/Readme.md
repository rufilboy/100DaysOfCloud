## Everything Containers

So I just did an article and it deleted when I went to save it so I learned the hard way to always make a copy of anything you do...ðŸ˜¢

## What are Containers? 

Containers are a form of operating system virtulization.  Containers are usually used for microservices but can also be used to run larger applications.  Containers do not contain OS (operating system) images which makes them more portable and lightweight.  When using larger applications you can use multiple containers which would be considered a container cluster. Inside containers there are binary codes, libraries and configuration files.

## Types of Containers

ECS stands for Elastic Compute Service which is a container orchastration service that support docker container services. You have to keep a server running even if you have no containers running. This is the most used container service.

ECR stands for Elastic Container Registry and it's a repository for conatiner images.

ECS Fargate is a serverless orchastration container service. It is the same as ECS but you pay-on-demand for the running container.

EKS stands for Elastic Kubernete Service and it is a fully managed kubernete service.
