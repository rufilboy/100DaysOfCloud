## Edge and Hybrid Computing Services

## What is Edge Computing?

Edge computing is when you push your computing workloads outside of your networks to run close to the destination location.  This can be withinin the device itsself or close to the device. Data is processed by its self or by local computer or service, rather then being transmitted to data centre.

## What is Hybrid Computing?

When you run workloads on both on-prem and datacentres and VPC (Virtual Prviate Cloud)

## Here are the different services

* AWS Outposts is a physical rack of services that you can put in your data centres. You can use AWS API and Servces such as EC2 in your datacaentre. 

* AWS Wavelength allows you to build and launch your applications in a telecome data centre. You wil have minimal delay, they will be pushed over a 5GB network and be closet to the end user.
