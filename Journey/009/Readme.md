## Virtual Private Cloud and Subnets

Today I refreshed my self on Virutal Private Cloud and Subnets. Virutual Private Cloud (VPC) is a isolated section of AWS Network where you launch your AWS resources.
Subnets: A private subnet is one that can't reach the internet which you can put data bases in that you want private and a public subnet is one that can reach the internet that you can put your servers in.
