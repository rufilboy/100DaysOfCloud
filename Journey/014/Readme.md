## AWS Sheild

Since I'm going over AWS security, today I chose to refresh my knowledge on AWS Sheild. Today I learned that AWS Sheild is a managed DDoS protection service that safeguards applications running on AWS. DDoS attack is flooding a website with a large amount of fake traffic.  Standard Sheild is free but there is also a Advanced Sheild that costs $3000 a year and is for additional protection for larger more sophisticated attacks and you also get 24/7 access to DDoS experts for complex cases.
