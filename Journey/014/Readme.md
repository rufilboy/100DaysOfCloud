## AWS Shield

Since I'm going over AWS Security, today I chose to refresh my knowledge on AWS Shield. Today I learned that AWS Shield is a managed DDoS protection service that safeguards applications running on AWS. DDoS attack is flooding a website with a large amount of fake traffic.  Standard Shield is free but there is also an Advanced Shield that costs $3000 a year and is for additional protection for larger more sophisticated attacks and you also get 24/7 access to DDoS experts for complex cases.
