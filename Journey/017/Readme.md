## VPN

Today I'm going over Virtual Private Nework (VPN). VPN gives you online privacy. Think of it like your own private tunnel from your network or device to the AWS global network.  There is AWS Site-to-Site VPN and AWS Client VPN.  

## AWS Site-to-Site VPN: 
Securely connect on-premises network or branch office site to VPC.

## AWS Client VPN:
Securly connect users to AWS or on-premises networks

## Social Proof
